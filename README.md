Warm water 120ml (as warm as spring sunshine ☀️, 35-40°C, you'll know when you touch it);  
Fresh eggs 2 (choose them like choosing a date 💝, intact shells, let them "date" at room temperature for 30 minutes);  
Green onions 2 (the white part should be as slender as a maiden's waist 🌿, chopped and ready, save the green part for decoration);  
Salt 3g (preferably sea salt or rock salt, the "soul seasoning master" of the pancake 🧂);  
Cooking oil 20ml (peanut oil or corn oil recommended, the secret weapon to make the pancake "fly" 🚀).

Rolling pin (30cm long, 2cm in diameter, the "personal trainer" for the dough 💪);

## Steps 👨‍🍳

### 1. Dough Making 🥟
<div style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.8; color: #1d1d1f; margin: 1.5em 0;">
First, let's give the flour a "luxury suite" (mixing bowl), precisely measure 200g of flour, make a small well in the center, like preparing a "hot spring pool" ♨️ for the flour. Then, prepare 120ml of warm water, as warm as spring sunshine, add 3g of salt, and stir until completely dissolved 🌊. Pour the warm water slowly into the flour well, stir clockwise with chopsticks, as elegant as dancing a waltz 💃. Then knead into a smooth dough with your hands, as gentle as a massage 👐, about 8-10 minutes, until the dough reaches the "three shines" standard: dough shines, bowl shines, hands shine ✨. Finally, cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it "take a nap" in a warm place (25-28°C) for 30 minutes 😴, during which we can prepare other ingredients.

### 2. Pancake Making 🥮
<div style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.8; color: #1d1d1f; margin: 1.5em 0;">
After the dough's "nap", we'll divide it into 4 equal portions (about 80g each), like dividing the dough's "inheritance" 📏. Roll them into balls and cover with a damp cloth to prevent drying, like putting on a "moisturizing mask" 🎭. Take one portion, sprinkle some dry flour, and roll it into a circle about 15cm in diameter, with the center slightly thicker (about 3mm) like a small hill ⛰️, and the edges as light as a maiden's skirt (about 2mm). Preheat the frying pan for 2 minutes, add 5ml of cooking oil, spread evenly with the silicone spatula, the oil temperature should be as passionate as summer sunshine (about 180°C) 🌞, you can test it with chopsticks - when small bubbles appear, the temperature is just right.

### 3. Egg Filling 🥚
<div style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.8; color: #1d1d1f; margin: 1.5em 0;">
Place the rolled dough in the pan, cook over medium-low heat for 1 minute. When large bubbles appear, poke a small hole in the center with chopsticks, like opening a "skylight" 🪟 for the pancake. Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl, add chopped green onions 🌿, and whisk quickly for about 30 seconds, like dancing the "egg liquid dance" 💃. Pour the egg mixture through the "skylight" quickly like lightning ⚡ to prevent leakage, immediately spread the egg with the silicone spatula, like "applying makeup" 💄 to the pancake.
</div>

### 4. Final Cooking ✨
<div style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.8; color: #1d1d1f; margin: 1.5em 0;">
When the egg is mostly set (about 1 minute), carefully flip with the silicone spatula, continue cooking for 1 minute until both sides are golden 🌟, like dressing the pancake in a "golden battle suit". Finally, transfer the pancake to a plate with the silicone spatula, brush with your favorite sauce while hot 🔥, like "applying makeup" to the pancake. You can add lettuce 🥬, ham 🥓, and other ingredients to make the pancake more "colorful" 🎨.

## Notes ⚠️
<div style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.8; color: #1d1d1f; margin: 1.5em 0;">
1. **Dough Handling**: The water temperature should be as warm as spring sunshine when kneading 🌅, not too hot or it will "burn" the gluten; the resting time should be sufficient to let the dough fully "rest" 😴; roll evenly to avoid uneven thickness, like "massaging" the dough 💆‍♂️.

2. **Heat Control**: Use medium-low heat throughout to avoid burning outside while raw inside, like "taking care" of a delicate child 👶; watch the color changes while cooking, like "admiring" a painting 🎨; adjust heat according to the pan material, like "training" a mischievous child 🎓.

3. **Hygiene and Safety**: Clean all tools before use, like "preparing" for a feast 🧹; separate raw and cooked ingredients, like "managing" a team 👥; ensure good kitchen ventilation to avoid smoke accumulation, like "taking care" of a delicate child 🌬️.
